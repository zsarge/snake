# snake

Inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/TOpBcfbAgPg)

This project uses the snake_case naming convention, for obvious reasons.

This project uses C++ 17.

-------

## in the project directory, build and run with:

```
make
```

```
./build/snake.out
```

## To do: 

- add [Hamiltonian pathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)

### Other:

I used a program structure that made sense to me, but it's one I haven't seen before.
I seperated the different topics in my code into namespaced functions (i.e. IMAGE_GEN & AI)
that operate on one snake object. I guess the alternative is having all that code in the main
snake class, but I like the way that namespaces seperate the concerns of the code.

TL;DR: idk what I'm doing, but I'm learning
